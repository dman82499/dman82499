- Currently working on AI, game development (formerly worked for corperate clash, now work on a UE4 first/third person survival game) and computational cognitive modeling with architectures such as SOAR. I also work for the SENSE lab at the Ohio State University. My current research interests include few shot learning techniques, including neurosymbolics and baysian program framework (BPL), as well as markov logic networks (MLN) and classical computer vision. I am also very interested in model based reinforcement learning.
